## Theory
A `language` is a set of strings form some finite, nonempty set of symbols.
It is specified by some rules. Is is designed to be used in situations where a natural language can not be utilized.
`Grammar` is formed from a group of non-terminal symbols, terminal symbols, start symbol and a set of productions (rules).

Grammar can be classified if three types:

- Type 0 Recursively Enumerable Grammar
- Type 1 Context-Sensitive Grammars
- Type 2 Context-Free Grammar
- Type 3 Regular Grammar

Finite automata is a model which reads the string, one symbol per time and we need it to recognize the pattern.
It will accept of reject the input string.
It has a finite number of states.


## Objectives:

1. Understand what a language is and what it needs to have in order to be considered a formal one.

2. Provide the initial setup for the evolving project that you will work on during this semester. I said project because usually at lab works, I encourage/impose students to treat all the labs like stages of development of a whole project. Basically you need to do the following:

   a. Create a local && remote repository of a VCS hosting service (let us all use Github to avoid unnecessary headaches);

   b. Choose a programming language, and my suggestion would be to choose one that supports all the main paradigms;

   c. Create a separate folder where you will be keeping the report. This semester I wish I won't see reports alongside source code files, fingers crossed;

3. According to your variant number (by universal convention it is register ID), get the grammar definition and do the following tasks:

   a. Implement a type/class for your grammar;

   b. Add one function that would generate 5 valid strings from the language expressed by your given grammar;

   c. Implement some functionality that would convert and object of type Grammar to one of type Finite Automaton;

   d. For the Finite Automaton, please add a method that checks if an input string can be obtained via the state transition from it;


## Implementation description

* About 2-3 sentences to explain each piece of the implementation.


* Code snippets from your files.

```
public static void main() 
{

}
```

* If needed, screenshots.
